JayPS Search CHANGELOG

July 22, 2014 : version 1.2
===========================
* Add possibility to search in specific field(s)

July 21, 2014 : version 1.1
===========================
* A setup can be configured to modify scoring depending on the nature of the fields.
  eg. a boost can be provided if the field is the title.
  See config/config.php
* API changed, split() method is deprecated, use wordScoring() instead.
  The new method takes the word and its config as params.
* A 'prepare_field' callback can be provided to prepare the value for a specific field, or for all the fields in general config.

November 6th, 2013: version 1.0
==============================
* Now support 'relation->field' syntax to index fields from relations (has_one, has_many, many_many and belongs_to)
* Add method force_reindex() on observed model to force its indexation
* Prevent errors with order_by if no keywords is used during search
* During a search, if all provided keywords are ignored (example: too shorts), return no results
* Bugfix: jayps_search_score + multiple relations
* Add option 'jayps_no_group_by' to be able to use Model::query()->count()
* Add property 'field_date_indexation' in behaviour configuration
* Compability with Novius-OS Chiba 2
* Check for "keywords" in complexe "where" clauses
* Novius-OS migration to create the table
* Support for multiple 'keywords' fields in where clause
* Add option 'jayps_search_exact_match' to order results with exact matches first (search with joker '*')
